# Snowflake-ETL

### Project Description:
In this comprehensive project, I was responsible for developing and implementing an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process using Snowflake and Python to handle diverse business data sets. This involved setting up a Snowflake environment, extracting data from multiple sources including CSV, XML, and PostgreSQL, and loading and transforming this data within Snowflake using SQL commands executed through Python. The goal was to prepare the data for advanced analytics, focusing on analyzing purchase order variances and the impact of weather conditions on business operations.

### Technology Stack:
- **Data Handling and Scripting**: Python, Snowflake SQL
- **Database and Data Warehousing**: Snowflake
- **Data Extraction and Loading Tools**: Snowflake Connector for Python, psycopg2 for PostgreSQL
- **Source Data Formats**: CSV, XML, PostgreSQL databases

### Key Accomplishments:
1. **Data Integration and Warehouse Setup**:
   - Configured and managed Snowflake settings, including warehouses, databases, and schemas.
   - Automated data extraction from various sources (CSV files, XML data, and PostgreSQL) directly into Snowflake using Python scripts.
   
2. **Data Transformation and Analysis**:
   - Developed SQL queries within Python to perform data transformations in Snowflake, reducing dependency on external data manipulation tools like Pandas.
   - Created SQL scripts to calculate differences between invoice amounts and purchase orders, and examined the influence of weather data on these variances.

3. **Performance Optimization and Automation**:
   - Utilized Snowflakeâ€™s capabilities for handling large datasets efficiently, such as COPY INTO for bulk data loading and materialized views for quick data retrieval.
   - Automated the entire ETL process, enabling seamless data flow from extraction at source points to transformations within Snowflake and loading into structured formats for analysis.

### Key Outcomes:
- **Efficient Data Management**: Established a robust data pipeline that consolidates and manages data from diverse formats, enhancing the accessibility and readiness of data for analytical purposes.
- **Enhanced Analytical Capabilities**: Enabled detailed business insights by linking transactional data with external factors like weather conditions, providing a nuanced understanding of operational impacts.
- **Automation and Scalability**: The implemented solutions are scalable and can be extended or modified for additional data sources or analytical requirements, ensuring adaptability to future business needs.
